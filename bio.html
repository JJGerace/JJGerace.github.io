    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jacob Gerace.</p>
    <p>Originally from a suburb of Syracuse New York, I graduated from Fayetteville-Manlius High School with an Advanced Regents Diploma in the Spring of 2012.</p>
    <p>I now attend Tufts University, where I am in my final year. I expect to graduate in May of 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical and Biological Engineering, with a second major in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I plan on starting a PHD in Chemical Engineering in the fall, currently I am in the process of selecting a graduate program. I hope to research the intersection of Computer Science and Chemical Engineering. Many options exist for this goal, for instance the computational modeling of chemical processes. </p>
