README.md for assignment 1 for Jacob Gerace

1. I have correctly implemented the entire assignment to my knowledge: index.html, bio.html, resume.html, and style.css

2. I did not collaborate with anyone, however I did start my style.css with the body id from the comp 20 webpage as a template. I also got a button template from www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp

3.I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment
